# Graphing Wikipedia
A Python script to download and map in a graph all of the Wikipedia articles and their connection to other articles. :snake: :page_facing_up: 

What are the applications of this, you ask?

Well, it is paramount. To be able to find the quickest way to get from one article, say [Ada_Lovelace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace) to [Splinter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splinter_(Teenage_Mutant_Ninja_Turtles)) from the Ninja Turtles.

What is the shortest paths of links from one article that we can follow to get to the other? In other words, what is their connection?

This is pivotal question and the world cannot wait any longer....

Sadly, my attempt to map the whole of Wikipedia by it's links came to a halt. Because of a lack of RAM and/or money to buy more, said RAM.  Thus, for now, this little project of mine has come to an end.

I'm sad to say the world will never be able to find out the connection between [Ada_Lovelace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace) and [Splinter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splinter_(Teenage_Mutant_Ninja_Turtles)).

Or the connection between [Medea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medea) and [Tom and Jerry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_and_Jerry)

I might try running it in a computer with more RAM, when I am able to.
